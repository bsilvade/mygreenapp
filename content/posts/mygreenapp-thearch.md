MyGreenApp is proud to have participated in The Arch, a major European event focused on advancing the ecological transition. This gathering was a valuable opportunity for us to engage with experts, innovators, and fellow entrepreneurs dedicated to forging a more sustainable future.

During The Arch, we delved into a wide range of environmental topics, gaining insights into cutting-edge sustainable solutions and practices from across Europe.

This event has reinforced our commitment to driving positive change through MyGreenApp, as we work tirelessly to promote sustainability and contribute to a greener world. Stay tuned for more updates on our journey towards a sustainable future! ðŸŒ±ðŸ’š
